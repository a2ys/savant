##### Savant */Ëˆsavnt/*

(**noun**) a person who has an exceptional aptitude in one particular field, such as music or mathematics, despite having significant impairment in other areas of intellectual or social functioning.

##### Savant is a community blog, where everyone has a chance to share their knowledge.

Savant started in early June of 2024 as a successor to my <a href="https://blog.a2ys.dev" target="_blank">old blog</a>. Compared to the previous blog, this blog has a new and required feature which is collaboration with other authors.

Savant allows anyone to share their knowledge to the world if they want. All the articles in the Savant blog will be available on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/a2ys/savant-articles" target="_blank">here</a>, and will accept any changes if required. You can contribute to any article you want, or write a completely new article for the blog.

If you have any query on how to edit or post a new article in this blog, you can contact us [here](/contact).
