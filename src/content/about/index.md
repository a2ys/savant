Savant started in June of 2024 as a successor to my [old blog](https://blog.a2ys.dev). Compared to the previous blog, this blog has a new and required feature which is collaboration with other authors.

Savant allows anyone to share their knowledge to the world if they want. You just need to contact through the Contact section in the website, or directly write to the email also mentioned in the Contact section.

All the articles in the Savant blog will be available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/a2ys/savant-articles), and will accept any changes if required. You can contribute to any article you want, or write a completely new article for the blog.
